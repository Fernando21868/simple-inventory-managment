# Overview

This project is a **Simple Inventory Management API** built using TypeScript and the NestJS framework. The purpose of this application is to provide a RESTful API to perform basic CRUD operations for managing items in an inventory. Each item includes attributes such as name, quantity, price, and category. The application emphasizes strong typing provided by TypeScript to ensure better code quality, reduce runtime errors, and deliver a more robust development experience.

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of TypeScript in a server-side context and to gain hands-on experience with NestJS, a powerful backend framework. This experience will strengthen my ability to build scalable, maintainable APIs for real-world applications.

# Development Environment

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: NestJS
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Tools**: Node.js, npm, Postman for API testing, and Visual Studio Code as the code editor

# Future Work

- Add authentication and authorization for secure access to the API endpoints.
- Implement advanced filtering and sorting options for inventory items.
- Integrate with a frontend interface for better user interaction.
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for all endpoints.
- Expand the API to support bulk operations (e.g., adding or updating multiple items at once).
